Browser debugger or extension to the browser debugger is the usual way of debugging Javascript-based web applications and Javascript-based frameworks like React, Angular, etc. For React-based apps, React Developer Tools is such an extension. There is nothing wrong with this approach of debugging. But having developed many java-based enterprise applications in previous years, I am someone who prefers to debug code inside my editor only. Visual Studio Code with its in-built debugging support for node.js runtime is perfect for this scenario.
